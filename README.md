# trakt-average

## Background

### History
Everytime I watch something and it gets scrobbled to [trakt](https://trakt.tv), I meticulously rate the item. So I was always annoyed when I finished watching a season or a show and it didn't use my rated episodes to calculate my season and/or show average rating - why should I have to rate this separately, again?

### How this works
It finds shows where either a season or a show is completed and then calculates the average over those items. Then it prints out those averages. In a second step, those values will be written back to trakt to update the season/show ratings.

### Why Java?
Because my java was getting rusty and I wanted to brush it up a little bit. Maybe I'll rewrite it in another language later, we'll see.
